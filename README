INSTRUCTIONS

WSAD to move the camera and HOLD RMB + MOUSE to rotate it.
HOLD SPACE to hide the menus for taking screenshots and
previewing the scene. F5 saves a screenshot to the editor
folder as "screenshot.png".

By default, EditorELF opens a empty scene. All of the
functionality can be found in the property sidebar on the
right. It contains various submenus which enable you to
open and import scenes and files, edit various actor
types and preview the scene with post processing effects
enabled.

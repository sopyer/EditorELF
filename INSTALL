INSTALL

To install EditorELF, you need the FreeMono.ttf font,
commonly found in linux distributions in /usr/shared/fonts
or online by googling.

1) Extract EditorELF to a folder or download it from git
2) make a folder called "fonts" to the same folder where
   EditorELF is (init.lua should reside in this folder)
3) Now you should be able to run EditorELF
